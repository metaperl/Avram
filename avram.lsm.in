Description:	An acronym for "Applicative ViRtuAl Machine", avram
is a virtual machine code interpreter. It reads an input file
containing a user-supplied application expressed in virtual machine
code, and executes it on the host machine. Notable features are strong
support for functional programming operations (e.g., list processing),
interoperability of virtual code applications with other console
applications or shells through libexpect, the ability to package
virtual code applications conveniently as self contained shell
scripts, and a choice of operating modes providing for either a simple
high-level interface to files, environment variables and command line
arguments, or various styles of stateless or persistent stream
processors (a.k.a. filters). The intended audience is writers of
compilers for programming, scripting, or special purpose languages,
whose projects stand to gain portability and ease of implementation.
The package includes a toy compiler for a simple lisp-like language
as a proof of concept.
