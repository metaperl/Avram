<h5 class="subsubsection">3.1.4.3 Two dimensional arrays</h5>

<p>Several other functions in <samp><span class="file">matcon.h</span></samp> are meant to support
conversions between matrices represented as lists of lists and arrays
in a variety of representations. Dense matrices either square or
<a name="index-matrices-450"></a>rectangular are accommodated, and symmetric square matrices can be
stored with redundant entries omitted in either upper trangular or
lower triangular format.

   <p>Similarly to the vector operations (<a href="One-dimensional-arrays.html#One-dimensional-arrays">One dimensional arrays</a>)
these functions are intended to allow a developer to present an
interface to external libraries based on lists rather than arrays.

   <p>The preferred convention for virtual code applications is to represent
a matrix as a list of lists of entities (typically numbers), with
one list for each row of the matrix. For example, a 3 by 3 matrix
containing a value of <code>aij</code> in the <code>i</code>-th row and the
<code>j</code>-th column would be represented by this list of three lists.

<pre class="example">     &lt;
        &lt;a11,a12,a13&gt;,
        &lt;a21,a22,a23&gt;,
        &lt;a31,a32,a33&gt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Such a representation is convenient for manipulation by
virtual machine combinators, for example <code>transpose</code>
(<a href="Transpose.html#Transpose">Transpose</a>), and is readily identified with the matrix
it represents.

   <p>If a matrix is symmetric (that is, with <code>aij</code> equal to
<code>aji</code> for all values of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>), only the lower
triangular portion needs to be stored because the other entries are
<a name="index-triangular-matrix-451"></a>redundant.  The list representatation would be something like this.

<pre class="example">     &lt;
        &lt;a11&gt;,
        &lt;a21,a22&gt;,
        &lt;a31,a32,a33&gt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Another alternative for representing a symmetric matrix is to store only the
upper triangular portion. In this case, a list such as the following would be used.

<pre class="example">     &lt;
        &lt;a11,a12,a13&gt;,
        &lt;a22,a23&gt;,
        &lt;a33&gt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The upper and lower triangular representations are distinguishable by
whether or not the row lengths form an increasing sequence.

   <p>In addition to representing symmetric matrices, these upper and lower
<a name="index-symmetric-matrix-452"></a>triangular forms are also appropriate for representing matrices whose
remaining entries are zero, such as the factors in an LU
decomposition. 
<a name="index-LU-decomposition-453"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>*avm_matrix_of_list</b> (<var>int square, int upper_triangular, int lower_triangular, int column_major, list operand, size_t item_size, list *message, int *fault</var>)<var><a name="index-g_t_002aavm_005fmatrix_005fof_005flist-454"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>This function converts a matrix in one of the list representations
above to a contiguous array according to the given specifications. 
The array can contain elements of any fixed sized type of size
<var>item_size</var>. The memory for it is allocated by this function and
it should be freed by the caller when no longer needed.

        <p>The input matrix is given by the list parameter, <var>operand</var>, and
its format is described by the integer parameters <var>square</var>,
<var>upper_triangular</var>, and <var>lower_triangular</var>. The number of
bytes occupied by each entry is given by <var>item_size</var>.

        <p>To the extent these specifications are redundant, they are used for
validation. If any of the following conditions is not met, the integer
referenced by <var>fault</var> is assigned a non-zero value and a copy
of the message <code>&lt;'bad matrix specification'&gt;</code> represented as
a list is assigned to the list referenced by <var>message</var>. Errors
are also possible due to insufficient memory.

          <ul>
<li>The <var>operand</var> must be a list of lists of lists such that
each item of each item is has a length of <var>item_size</var>,
and its items consist of character representations as
required by <code>avm_value_of_list</code> (<a href="Primitive-types.html#Primitive-types">Primitive types</a>). 
<li>If the lengths of the top level lists in the <var>operand</var> form an
increasing sequence, the lower triangular representation is assumed
and the <var>lower_triangular</var> parameter must have a non-zero value. 
<li>If the lengths of the top level lists in the <var>operand</var> form a
decreasing sequence, the upper triangular representation is assumed
and the <var>upper_triangular</var> parameter must have a non-zero value. 
<li>At least one of <var>upper_triangular</var> or <var>lower_triangular</var> must
be zero. 
<li>If <var>square</var> has a non-zero value, then either all items of the
<var>operand</var> must have the same length as the operand, or if it's
triangular, then the longest one must have the same length as the
operand. 
<li>If the <var>operand</var> is neither square nor a triangular form, all
items of it are required to have the same length. 
</ul>

        <p>The parameters <var>upper_triangular</var> or <var>lower_triangular</var> may be
set to non-zero values even if the <var>operand</var> is not in one of the
upper or lower triangular forms discussed above. In this case, the
<var>operand</var> must be square or rectangular (i.e., with all items the
same length), and the following interpretations apply.

          <ul>
<li>If <var>upper_triangular</var> is non-zero, the diagonal elements and the
upper triangular portion of the input matrix are copied to the output. 
The lower triangle of the input is ignored and the lower triangle of
the output is left uninitialized. 
<li>If <var>lower_triangular</var> is non-zero, the diagonal elements and the
lower triangular portion of the input matrix are copied to the output. 
The upper triangle of the input is ignored and the upper triangle of
the output is left uninitialized. 
</ul>

        <p>The <var>column_major</var> parameter affects the form of the output array. 
If it is zero, then each row of the input matrix is stored in a
contiguous block of memory in the output array, and if it is non-zero,
each column is stored contiguously. 
<a name="index-Fortran-455"></a>The latter representation is also
known as Fortran order and may be required by library functions
written in Fortran.

        <p>In all cases when a triangular form is specified, part of the output
matrix is left uninitialized. The redundant entries may be assigned if
required by the <code>avm_reflect_matrix</code> function (<a href="Related-utility-functions.html#Related-utility-functions">Related utility functions</a>).

&mdash; Function: list <b>avm_list_of_matrix</b> (<var>void *matrix, int rows, int cols, size_t item_size, int *fault</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005flist_005fof_005fmatrix-456"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function performs an inverse operation to
<code>avm_matrix_of_list</code> by taking the address of a matrix stored as
a contiguous array in the parameter <var>matrix</var> and constructing the
list representation as discussed above. Only square and rectangular
matrices in row major order are supported, but see
<code>avm_matrix_transposition</code> for a way to convert between row major
<a name="index-column-major-order-457"></a>and column major order (<a href="Related-utility-functions.html#Related-utility-functions">Related utility functions</a>).

        <p>The parameters <var>rows</var>, <var>cols</var>, and <var>item_size</var> describe
the form of the matrix. The list returned as a result will have a
length of <var>rows</var>, and each item will be a list of length
<var>cols</var>. Each item of the result corresponds to a row of the
matrix, and each item of the items represents the an entry of the
matrix as a list of length <var>item_size</var>. These items could be
passed to <code>avm_value_of_list</code>, for example, to obtain their
values (<a href="Primitive-types.html#Primitive-types">Primitive types</a>).

        <p>Memory is allocated by this function to create the list, which can be
reclaimed by <code>avm_dispose</code> (<a href="Simple-Operations.html#Simple-Operations">Simple Operations</a>). If there is
insufficient memory, the integer referenced by <var>fault</var> is assigned
a non-zero value and the result returned is a list representation of
the message <code>&lt;'memory overflow'&gt;</code>. The error message be reclaimed
by the caller as well using <code>avm_dispose</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A packed storage representation for symmetric square matrices and
<a name="index-packed-arrays-458"></a>triangular matrices is of interest because it is used by some library
functions, notably those in <code>LAPACK</code>, to save memory and thereby
accommodate larger problems. In this representation, column major
<a name="index-column-major-order-459"></a>order is assumed, and either the lower or the upper triangle of the
matrix is not explicitly stored. For example, a lower triangular
<a name="index-triangular-matrix-460"></a>matrix whose list representation corresponds to

<pre class="example">     &lt;
        &lt;a11&gt;,
        &lt;a21,a22&gt;,

        &lt;a41,a42,a43,a44&gt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would be stored according to the memory map

   <p>A couple of functions converting between list representations and
packed array format are provided as described below.

triangular and zero otherwise.

        <p>If the <var>operand</var> is not in a triangular form, then each item of
the operand must be a list of length <var>n</var>. In this case, the

        <p>If the input parameters are inconsistent or if there is insufficient

non-empty message must be reclaimed by the caller using
<code>avm_dispose</code> (<a href="Simple-Operations.html#Simple-Operations">Simple Operations</a>).

        <p>If there are no errors, the result is a pointer to a packed array
