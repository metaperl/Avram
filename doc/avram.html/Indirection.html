<h4 class="subsection">3.1.7 Indirection</h4>

<p>In some cases it is necessary to build a tree from the top down rather
<a name="index-pointers-489"></a>than from the bottom up, when it is not known in advance what's on the
bottom. Although the <code>list</code> type is a pointer itself, these
situations call for a type of pointers to lists, which are declared as
the <code>branch</code> type in <samp><span class="file">branches.h</span></samp>. For example, if <code>b</code> is
declared as a <code>branch</code> and <code>l</code> is declared as a <code>list</code>,
it would be possible to write <code>b = &amp;l</code>.

   <p>Facilities are also provided for maintaining queues of branches, which
<a name="index-queues-490"></a>are declared as the <code>branch_queue</code> type. This type is a pointer to
a structure with two fields, <code>above</code> and <code>following</code>, where
<code>above</code> is a <code>branch</code> and <code>following</code> is a
<code>branch_queue</code>.

   <p>These functions are used internally elsewhere in the library and might
not be necessary for most client programs to use directly.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_initialize_branches</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005finitialize_005fbranches-491"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This must be done once before any of the other branch related functions is
used, and creates some internal data structures. Results of the other
functions are undefined if this one isn't called first. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_count_branches</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005fcount_005fbranches-492"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function can be used at the end of a run to detect unreclaimed
storage used for branches or branch queues. If any storage remains
unreclaimed, a message about unreclaimed branches is written to standard
error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_anticipate</b> (<var>branch_queue *front, branch_queue *back, branch operand</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fanticipate-493"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function provides a simple queueing facility for
branches. Similarly to the case with <code>avm_enqueue</code>, <code>front</code>
and <code>back</code> should be initialized to <code>NULL</code> before the first
call. Each call to this function will enqueue one item to the back,
assuming enough memory is available, as the following example shows.

     <pre class="example">          front = NULL;
          back = NULL;
          l = avm_join(NULL,NULL);
          anticipate(&amp;front,&amp;back,&amp;(l-&gt;head));
          anticipate(&amp;front,&amp;back,&amp;(l-&gt;tail));
</pre>
        <p>After the above code is executed, these postconditions will hold.

     <pre class="example">          front-&gt;above == &amp;(l-&gt;head)
          front-&gt;following-&gt;above == &amp;(l-&gt;tail)
          front-&gt;following == back
          back-&gt;following == NULL
</pre>
        <p>The name &ldquo;anticipate&rdquo; is used because ordinarily the queue contains
positions in a tree to be filled in later. As usual, only unshared trees should be
modified in place. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_recoverable_anticipate</b> (<var>branch_queue *front, branch_queue *back, branch operand, int *fault</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005frecoverable_005fanticipate-494"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>avm_anticipate</code>, except that it will
not exit with an error message in the event of an overflow error, but
will simply set <code>*</code><var>fault</var> to a non-zero value and return to the
caller. If an overflow occurs, nothing about the queue is changed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_enqueue_branch</b> (<var>branch_queue *front, branch_queue *back, int received_bit</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fenqueue_005fbranch-495"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A slightly higher level interface to the <code>avm_anticipate</code> function
is provided by this function, which is useful for building a tree from
<a name="index-trees-496"></a>a string of input bits in a format similar to the one described in
<a href="Concrete-Syntax.html#Concrete-Syntax">Concrete Syntax</a>.

        <p>This function should be called the first time with <code>front</code> and
<code>back</code> having been initialized to represent a queue containing a
<a name="index-queues-497"></a>single branch pointing to a list known to the caller. The list itself
need not be allocated or initialized. An easy way of doing so would be
the following.

     <pre class="example">          front = NULL;
          back = NULL;
          avm_anticipate(&amp;front,&amp;back,&amp;my_list);
</pre>
        <p>On each call to <code>avm_enqueue_branch</code>, the <var>received_bit</var>
parameter is examined. If it is zero, nothing will be added to the
queue, the list referenced by the front branch will be assigned
<code>NULL</code>, and the front branch will be removed from the queue. If
<var>received_bit</var> is a non-zero value, the list referenced by
the front branch will be assigned to point to a newly created unshared
list node, and two more branches will be appended to the queue. The
first branch to be appended will point to the head of the newly created
list node, and the second branch to be appended will point to the tail.

        <p>If the sequence of bits conforms to the required concrete syntax, this
function can be called for each of them in turn, and at the end of the
sequence, the queue will be empty and the list referenced by the initial
branch (i.e., <code>my_list</code>) will be the one specified by the bit
string. If the sequence of bits does not conform to the required
concrete syntax, the error can be detected insofar as the emptying of
the queue will not coincide exactly with the last bit.

        <p>The caller should check for the queue becoming prematurely empty due to
syntax errors, because no message is reported by
<code>avm_enqueue_branch</code> in that event, and subsequent attempts to
enqueue anything are ignored. However, in the event of a memory overflow,
an error message is reported and the process is terminated. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_recoverable_enqueue_branch</b> (<var>branch_queue *front, branch_queue *back, int received_bit, int *fault</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005frecoverable_005fenqueue_005fbranch-498"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>avm_enqueue_branch</code> but will leave
error handling to the caller in the event of insufficient memory to
enqueue another branch. Instead of printing an error message and
exiting, it will dispose of the queue, set the <var>fault</var> flag
to a non-zero value, and return. Although the queue will be reclaimed,
the lists referenced by the branches in it will persist. The list nodes
themselves can be reclaimed by disposing of the list whose address was
stored originally in the front branch.

<blockquote><p>This function deallocates a branch queue by chasing the <code>following</code>
fields in each one. It does nothing to the lists referenced by the
branches in the queue.

        <p>Rather than using <code>free</code> directly, client programs should use this
function for deallocating branch queues, because it allows better
performance by interacting with a local internal cache of free memory,
and because it performs necessary bookkeeping for
<code>avm_count_branches</code>.
