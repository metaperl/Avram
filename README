avram - applicative virtual machine code interpreter

Copyright (C) 2006,2007,2012 Dennis Furey

This package includes a virtual machine code interpreter and a
development library. It enables you to run programs that have been
compiled into the virtual code format that it uses. A compiler to
generate code in this format is available separately at
https://github.com/gueststar/Ursala. 

This is a feature branch dedicated to migrating from autotools
to CMake. Installation instructions haven't been written yet.
