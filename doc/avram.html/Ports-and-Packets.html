<h4 class="subsection">3.8.2 Ports and Packets</h4>

<p>A pointer type declared as a <code>port</code> points to a structure in the
following form, where a <code>flag</code> is an unsigned short integer type,
and a <code>counter</code> is an unsigned long integer. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcounter_007d-635"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bflag_007d-636"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bavm_005fpacket_007d-637"></a>
<pre class="example">     struct avm_packet
     {
       port parent;
       counter errors;
       portal descendents;
       list impetus, contents;
       flag predicating;
     };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For reasons that make sense to C, the <code>avm_packet</code> and <code>port</code>
types are declared in <code>lists.h</code>, but a few memory management
operations on them are available by way of functions declared in
<samp><span class="file">ports.h</span></samp>. The intended meaning of this structure is described
presently, but first the memory management functions are as follows.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: port <b>avm_newport</b> (<var>counter errors, port parent, int predicating</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fnewport-638"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function attempts to allocate storage for a new packet structure
and returns its address if successful. If storage can not be allocated,
a <code>NULL</code> pointer is returned. The <code>errors</code>, <code>parent</code>, and
<code>predicating</code> fields are initialized with the parameters supplied
by the caller. The rest of the structure is filled with zeros. A local
memory cache is used for improved performance. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_sever</b> (<var>port appendage</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fsever-639"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function reclaims the storage associated with a <code>port</code>, either
freeing it entirely or holding it in a local cache.  None of the
entities that may be referenced by pointers within the structure are
affected.  Only this function should be used by client programs for
disposing of ports, not the <code>free</code> function directly, or some
internal bookkeeping will be disrupted. An internal error results if the
argument is a <code>NULL</code> pointer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_initialize_ports</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005finitialize_005fports-640"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function must be called prior to calling either of the two above,
in order to initialize some static variables. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_count_ports</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005fcount_005fports-641"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function may be called after the last call to any of the other
functions in this section in order to detect and report unreclaimed
storage associated with ports. A non-fatal warning will be written to
standard error if any is detected, but otherwise there is no effect. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The interesting aspect of this data structure is the role it plays in
capturing the state of a computation. For this purpose, it corresponds
to a single node in a partially computed result to be represented by a
<code>list</code> when it's finished. The nodes should be envisioned as a
doubly-linked binary tree, except that the pair of <code>descendents</code>
for each node is not yet known with certainty, so a list of alternatives
must be maintained.

   <p>Because the computation is not completed while this data structure
exists, there are always some empty fields in it. For example, the
<code>descendents</code> and the <code>contents</code> fields embody the same
information, the latter doing so in a compact as opposed to a more
expanded form. Hence, it would be redundant for both fields to be
non-empty at the same time. The data structure is built initially with
<code>descendents</code> and no <code>contents</code>, only to be transformed into
one with <code>contents</code> and no <code>descendents</code>.

   <p>The significance of each field in the structure can be summarized as
follows.

     <dl>
<dt><code>contents</code><dd>If the computational result destined for the <code>port</code> pointing to this packet
is not complete, then this field is <code>NULL</code> and the
<code>descendents</code> are being computed. Otherwise, it contains the result
of the computation. 
<br><dt><code>descendents</code><dd>This field points to a list of pairs of ports serving as the
destinations for an ensemble of concurrent computations.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <code>head</code>
and <code>tail</code> of the <code>contents</code> are to be identified respectively
with the <code>contents</code> of the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> <code>port</code>
in the first pair to finish being computed. 
<br><dt><code>parent</code><dd>If this packet is addressed by the <code>left</code> or the <code>right</code> of
<code>port</code> in one of the <code>descendents</code> of some other packet, then
this field points to that packet. 
<br><dt><code>errors</code><dd>A non-zero value in this field indicates that the result destined for
the <code>contents</code> of this packet is expected to be an error
message. If the exact level of error severity incurred in the
computation of the <code>contents</code> matches this number, then the
contents can be assigned the result, but otherwise the result should
propagate to the <code>contents</code> of the <code>parent</code>. 
<br><dt><code>predicating</code><dd>A non-zero value in this field implies that the result destined for the
<code>contents</code> of this packet is being computed in order to decide
which arm of a conditional function should be chosen. I.e., a
<code>NULL</code> result calls for the one that is invoked when the predicate
is false. 
<br><dt><code>impetus</code><dd>If the result destined for the <code>contents</code> of this packet is being
computed in order to transform a virtual code fragment from its original
form to an equivalent representation capable of being evaluated more
directly, this field points to a <code>list</code> node at the root of the
virtual code in its original form. 
</dl>

   <p>One of the hitherto undocumented fields in a <code>list</code> node structure
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterpretation_007d-642"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bimpetus_007d-643"></a>declared in <samp><span class="file">lists.h</span></samp> is called the <code>interpretation</code>, and is
of type <code>list</code>. A client program delving into sufficient depth of
detail to be concerned with ports and packets may reasonably assign the
<code>interpretation</code> field of the <code>list</code> referenced by the
<code>impetus</code> field in a packet to be a copy of the <code>contents</code> of
the packet when they are eventually obtained. Doing so will save some
time by eliminating the need for it to be recomputed if the same virtual
code should be executed again.

   <p>If this course is taken, the <code>facilitator</code> field in a <code>list</code>
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfacilitator_007d-644"></a>node, also hitherto undocumented, should contain the address of the
packet referring to the list node as its <code>impetus</code>. The reason for
this additional link is so that it can be followed when the
<code>impetus</code> of the packet is be cleared by <code>avm_dispose</code> in the
event that the <code>list</code> node is freed before the computation
completes. This action is performed in order to preclude a dangling
pointer in the <code>impetus</code> field.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Earlier
versions of <code>avram</code> included a bottom avoiding choice combinator
that required this feature, but which has been withdrawn. A single pair
of descendent ports would now suffice.</p>
