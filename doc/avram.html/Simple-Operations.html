<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Simple Operations</h4>

<p>These functions are declared in the header file <code>lists.h</code>, which
should be included in any C source file that uses them with a directive
such as <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;avm/lists.h&gt;<!-- /@w --></code>. All of these functions except
the first three have the potential cause a memory overflow. In that
<a name="index-overflow-399"></a>event, a brief message is written to standard error and the process is
killed rather than returning to the caller. It is possible for client
programs requiring more robust behavior to do their own error handling
by using the alternative versions of these operations described in the
next section.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_initialize_lists</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005finitialize_005flists-400"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The function <code>avm_initialize_lists</code> should be called before any of
the other ones in this section is called, because it sets up some
internal data structures. Otherwise, the behavior of the other functions
is undefined. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_dispose</b> (<var>list front</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fdispose-401"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function deallocates the memory associated with a given list,
either by consigning it to a cache maintained internally by the library,
or by the standard <code>free</code> function if the cache is full. Shared
lists are taken into account and handled properly according to a
reference counting scheme. Lists should be freed only by this function,
not by using <code>free</code> directly. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_count_lists</b> ()<var><a name="index-avm_005fcount_005flists-402"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If a client program aims to do its own storage reclamation, this
function can be called optionally at the end of a run when it is
believed that all lists have been freed. If any allocated lists remain
at large, a warning will be printed to standard error. This function
therefore provides a useful check for memory leaks. Overhead is small
enough that it is not infeasible to leave this check in the production
code. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: list <b>avm_copied</b> (<var>list operand</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fcopied-403"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A copy of the argument list is returned by this function. The copy
remains intact after the original is reclaimed. A typical use might be
for retaining part of a list after the rest of it is no longer
needed. In this example, a list <code>x</code> is traversed by a hypothetical
<code>visit</code> function to each item, which is then immediately reclaimed.

     <pre class="example">          while(x){
             visit(x-&gt;head);
             old_x = x;
             x = avm_copied(x-&gt;tail);       /* the right way */
             avm_dispose(old_x);
          }
</pre>
        <p>This example allows each item in the list to be visited even as
previously visited items are reclaimed, because <code>x</code> is copied at
each iteration. This example contrasts with the next one, which will
probably cause a segmentation fault. 
<a name="index-segmentation-fault-404"></a>
     <pre class="example">          while(x){
             visit(x-&gt;head);
             old_x = x;
             x = x-&gt;tail;                   /* the wrong way */
             avm_dispose(old_x);
          }
</pre>
        <p>In the second example, a reference is made to a part of a list which no
longer exists because it has been deallocated.

        <p>In fact, the <code>avm_copied</code> function does nothing but increment a
reference count, so it is a fast, constant time operation that requires
<a name="index-reference-count-405"></a>no additional memory allocation. Semantically this action is equivalent
to creating a fresh copy of the list, because all list operations in the
library deal with reference counts properly. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: list <b>avm_join</b> (<var>list left, list right</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fjoin-406"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function takes a pair of lists to a list in which the left is the
head and the right is the tail. It may need to use <code>malloc</code> to
allocate additional memory. If there is insufficient memory, an error
message is written to standard error and the program exits. 
When the list returned by <code>avm_join</code> is eventually deallocated, the
lists from which it was built are taken with it and must not be
referenced again. For example, the following code is an error.

     <pre class="example">          z = avm_join(x,y);
          ...
          avm_dispose(z);
          avm_print_list(x);         /* error here */
</pre>
        <p>To accomplish something similar to this without an error, a copy of
<code>x</code> should be made, as in the next example.

     <pre class="example">          z = avm_join(avm_copied(x),y);
          ...
          avm_dispose(z);
          avm_print_list(x);         /* original x still intact */
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>avm_enqueue</b> (<var>list *front, list *back, list operand</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005fenqueue-407"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-queues-408"></a>A fast simple way of building a list head first is provided by the
<code>enqueue</code> function. The <code>front</code> is a pointer to the beginning
of the list being built, and the <code>back</code> is a pointer to the last
item. The recommended way to use it would be something like this.

     <pre class="example">          front = back = NULL;
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,item);
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,next_item);
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,another_item);
          ...
</pre>
        <p>It might be more typical for the calls to <code>avm_enqueue</code> to appear
within a loop. In any case, after the above code is executed, the
following postconditions will hold.

     <pre class="example">          front-&gt;head == item
          front-&gt;tail-&gt;head == next_item
          front-&gt;tail-&gt;tail-&gt;head == another_item
          back-&gt;head == another_item
          back-&gt;tail == NULL
</pre>
        <p>The <code>avm_enqueue</code> function must never be used on a shared list, because
it modifies its arguments in place. The only practical way to guarantee
that a list is not shared is to initialize the <code>front</code> and <code>back</code> to
<code>NULL</code> as shown before the first call to <code>avm_enqueue</code>, and to
make no copies of <code>front</code> or <code>back</code> until after the last call
to <code>avm_enqueue</code>.

        <p>Because a list built with <code>avm_enqueue</code> is not shared, it is one of the
few instances of a list that can have something harmlessly appended to
it in place. For example, if the next line of code were

     <pre class="example">          back-&gt;tail = rest_of_list;
</pre>
        <p>that would be acceptable assuming <code>rest_of_list</code> is not shared and
does not conceal a dangling or cyclic reference, and if nothing further
were enqueued.

        <p>The items that are enqueued into a list are not copied and will be
deallocated when the list is deallocated, so they must not be referenced
thereafter. A non-obvious violation of this convention is implicit in
the following code.

     <pre class="example">          ...
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,x-&gt;head);
          ...
          avm_dispose(front);
          avm_print_list(x);      /* error here  */
</pre>
        <p>This code might cause a segmentation fault because of the reference to
<a name="index-segmentation-fault-409"></a><code>x</code> after its head has been deallocated. The following code is
subject to the same problem,

     <pre class="example">          ...
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,x-&gt;head);
          ...
          avm_dispose(x);
          avm_print_list(front);       /* error here */
</pre>
        <p>as is the following.

     <pre class="example">          ...
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,x-&gt;head);
          ...
          avm_dispose(x);       /* front is now impossible to reclaim */
          avm_dispose(front);
</pre>
        <p>The problem with the last example is that it is not valid even to
dispose of the same list more than once, albeit indirectly.

        <p>If part of a list is intended to be enqueued temporarily or
independently of its parent, the list should be copied explicitly, as
the following code demonstrates.

     <pre class="example">          ...
          avm_enqueue(&amp;front,&amp;back,avm_copied(x-&gt;head));   /* correct */
          ...
          avm_dispose(front);
          avm_print_list(x);
</pre>

&mdash; Function: counter <b>avm_length</b> (<var>list operand</var>)<var><a name="index-avm_005flength-410"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A <code>counter</code> is meant to be the longest unsigned integer available
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcounter_007d-411"></a>on the host machine, and is defined in <code>common.h</code>, which is
automatically included whenever <code>lists.h</code> is included. The
