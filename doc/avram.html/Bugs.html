There are no known bugs outstanding, except for any that may be
inherent in the external library functions. However, <code>avram</code> has
been used most extensively on GNU/Linux systems, and the prospect
of portability issues with new or lesser used features on other
systems can't be excluded.

   <p>Though not observed in practice, it's theoretically possible to blow
the stack by passing enough functions as arguments to library
functions that pass more functions to library functions (e.g., by
using nested calls to the gsl integration functions meant for a single
variable to evaluate a very high dimensional multiple integral). In
all other cases only dynamic heap storage or a constant amount of
stack space is used.  In particular, this issue is <em>not</em> relevant
to virtual code applications that don't use external libraries, or
that don't pass functions to them as arguments.

   <p><code>avram</code> is designed to recover gracefully from memory overflows
by always checking for <code>NULL</code> results from <code>malloc()</code> or
otherwise trapping functions that allocate memory. In the event of an
overflow, it conveys an appropriate error message to the virtual code
application to be handled by the usual exception handling
mechanisms. However, there is currently no way for a virtual code
application to detect in advance whether sufficient memory is
available, nor for it to resume normal operation once an exception
occurs. Furthermore, it has been observed on some systems including
Irix and 2.4 series Linux kernels that the <code>avram</code> process is
killed automatically for attempting to allocate too much memory rather
than given the chance to recover.
